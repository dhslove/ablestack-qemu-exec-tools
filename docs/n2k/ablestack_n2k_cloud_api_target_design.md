# ablestack_n2k ABLESTACK Cloud API target design

## Purpose

This document describes how `ablestack_n2k` should create the target VM through the ABLESTACK Cloud API instead of generating and applying a libvirt XML definition directly on the KVM host.

The existing migration data path remains valid:

```text
Nutanix source snapshot/recovery point
  -> n2k base/incremental/final disk sync
  -> target storage image or block device
```

The new design changes only the target cutover path:

```text
Current: generate libvirt XML -> virsh define -> virsh start
New:     Cloud API import volume -> deploy VM from imported volume -> attach data disks -> start VM
```

## Branch and API verification

The ABLESTACK Cloud source was checked in the local WSL clone:

```text
/root/work/ablestack-cloud
branch: ablestack-diplo
commit: 57aae906bf115e210f176f785be9600e99cda742
```

The `deployVirtualMachineForVolume` API exists in code and is registered as a management-server API command.

Relevant code paths:

| Area | File | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User command | `/root/work/ablestack-cloud/api/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/api/command/user/vm/DeployVMVolumeCmd.java` | `@APICommand(name = "deployVirtualMachineForVolume", ...)` |
| Admin command | `/root/work/ablestack-cloud/api/src/main/java/org/apache/cloudstack/api/command/admin/vm/DeployVMVolumeCmdByAdmin.java` | Admin view for the same API name |
| Command registration | `/root/work/ablestack-cloud/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/server/ManagementServerImpl.java` | Adds both `DeployVMVolumeCmdByAdmin.class` and `DeployVMVolumeCmd.class` |
| VM creation implementation | `/root/work/ablestack-cloud/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/vm/UserVmManagerImpl.java` | `createVirtualMachineVolume(DeployVMVolumeCmd cmd)` |
| Start implementation | `/root/work/ablestack-cloud/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/vm/UserVmManagerImpl.java` | `startVirtualMachineVolume(DeployVMVolumeCmd cmd)` |

The command accepts a `volumeid` parameter and the implementation marks the imported volume as device `0`, associates it with the dummy VM import template, and then creates a VM. This is the API path n2k should use for the target root disk.

## Runtime API findings

The 22.x ABLESTACK Cloud lab management API was tested at:

```text
http://10.10.22.10:8080/client/api
```

Credential handling note:

- API keys and secret keys must not be committed to this repository.
- Runtime code should accept them through environment variables, a protected credential file, or CLI options.
- Logs and manifest files must redact the secret key and signature.

Important authentication finding:

- This ABLESTACK Cloud branch verifies API signatures with `HmacSHA256`.
- Generic Apache CloudStack examples often use `HmacSHA1`; that fails with HTTP `401` in this environment.
- n2k must sign requests using `HmacSHA256`, lowercase the unsigned request string, and send the Base64 signature.

Observed API availability:

| API | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `listApis` | Available |
| `listZones` | Available |
| `listStoragePools` | Available |
| `listVolumesForImport` | Available |
| `importVolume` | Available |
| `unmanageVolume` | Available |
| `deployVirtualMachineForVolume` | Available |
| `attachVolume` | Available |
| `startVirtualMachine` | Available |
| `queryAsyncJobResult` | Available |

Observed target resources:

| Resource | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Zone | `Zone-22` |
| Zone ID | `d5551005-3372-43e5-8a2b-5742057bbabd` |
| Cluster | `Cluster` |
| RBD primary storage | `Primary Storage Glue RBD` |
| RBD storage ID | `91cae554-3fce-3f93-89d1-cefaf9bf8122` |
| RBD pool path | `rbd` |
| RBD storage provider | `ABLESTACK` |
| Active KVM hosts | `ablecube22-1`, `ablecube22-2`, `ablecube22-3` |
| Default disk offering policy | n2k-managed `N2K Migration Writeback`, no tags, `cachemode=writeback` |

RBD import path behavior:

| n2k target path | Cloud import path |
| --- | --- |
| `rbd:rbd/<image>` | `<image>` preferred |
| `rbd:rbd/<image>` | `rbd/<image>` also accepted |
| `rbd:rbd/<image>` | `/rbd/<image>` rejected |

Validation result:

- A 1 GiB temporary RBD image was visible through `listVolumesForImport`.
- `importVolume` successfully registered it as a `DATADISK` volume in `Ready` state.
- `unmanageVolume` successfully removed CloudStack management of that test volume.
- The temporary RBD image was removed after the test.
- A 64 MiB image failed import because the Cloud disk policy requires at least 1 GiB.

Cloud FileSystem and SharedMountPoint path behavior:

- Cloud file-backed import does not use n2k's libvirt default path.
- For `Filesystem`, `NetworkFilesystem`, and `SharedMountPoint` storage pools,
  n2k must query `listStoragePools` for the selected `storageid` and use the
  returned storage pool `path` as the qcow2 target root.
- Target qcow2 files must be root-level files directly under that storage pool
  path. Subdirectories are not valid for this import path because the KVM agent
  resolves the basename against the selected pool local path.
- The 10.10.1.x test caught the invalid old behavior: files were created under
  `/var/lib/libvirt/images` while the selected Cloud pool path was
  `/mnt/glue-gfs`.
- Detailed rules are recorded in
  `docs/n2k/ablestack_n2k_cloud_storage_path_design.md`.

## Design goals

- Keep the existing libvirt target path working unchanged.
- Add ABLESTACK Cloud API as a second target provider.
- Reuse the existing n2k source, snapshot, sync, RBD, qcow2, block, and phase1/phase2 machinery.
- Replace only the target VM creation/start path when Cloud API mode is selected.
- Support root disk and multiple data disks.
- Prefer RBD primary storage first, then add file primary storage support after path behavior is verified.
- For file-backed Cloud storage, derive the qcow2 target root from the selected
  Cloud storage pool path instead of using host-local defaults.
- Keep all secret material out of manifests, docs, shell history where possible, and logs.
- Make retry and cleanup behavior explicit because Cloud API operations are asynchronous.

## Target model

The current manifest stores:

```json
{
  "target": {
    "type": "kvm",
    "format": "raw",
    "storage": {
      "type": "rbd",
      "rbd_access_mode": "krbd"
    },
    "libvirt": {
      "name": "vm-name"
    }
  }
}
```

The design adds a target provider layer:

```json
{
  "target": {
    "type": "kvm",
    "provider": "ablestack-cloud",
    "format": "raw",
    "storage": {
      "type": "rbd",
      "rbd_access_mode": "krbd"
    },
    "cloud": {
      "endpoint": "http://10.10.22.10:8080/client/api",
      "zone_id": "d5551005-3372-43e5-8a2b-5742057bbabd",
      "service_offering_id": "",
      "network_ids": [],
      "storage_id": "91cae554-3fce-3f93-89d1-cefaf9bf8122",
      "disk_offering_id": "",
      "resolved_disk_offering": {
        "id": "",
        "name": "N2K Migration Writeback",
        "storage_type": "shared",
        "cache_mode": "writeback",
        "customized": true,
        "created": false
      },
      "host_id": "",
      "account": "",
      "domain_id": "",
      "project_id": "",
      "vm_id": "",
      "imported_volumes": []
    }
  }
}
```

Secrets must not be stored in this structure. The API key can be stored only if the operator explicitly chooses a credential file path outside the manifest, but the default behavior should avoid storing both API key and secret.

## CLI additions

Add target provider options to `preflight`, `plan`, `init`, `run`, and `cutover`.

```text
--target-provider <provider>       libvirt|ablestack-cloud, default libvirt
--cloud-endpoint <url>             Cloud API endpoint
--cloud-api-key <key>              Cloud API key, runtime only
--cloud-secret-key <key>           Cloud secret key, runtime only
--cloud-cred-file <file>           Protected credential file
--cloud-zone-id <uuid>             Target zone
--cloud-service-offering-id <uuid> Target compute offering
--cloud-cpu-speed <mhz>            Dynamic offering CPU speed detail, default 1000
--cloud-network-id <uuid>          Repeatable network ID option
--cloud-storage-id <uuid>          Target primary storage pool
--cloud-disk-offering-id <uuid>    Optional override for the auto-managed n2k disk offering
--cloud-host-id <uuid>             Optional host placement
--cloud-account <name>             Optional target account
--cloud-domain-id <uuid>           Optional target domain
--cloud-project-id <uuid>          Optional target project
```

For later usability, allow names as a convenience only after UUID resolution is implemented:

```text
--cloud-zone <name>
--cloud-service-offering <name>
--cloud-network <name>
--cloud-storage <name>
--cloud-disk-offering <name>
```

Initial implementation should require UUIDs for `run/cutover` and allow name lookup only in `preflight/plan`.

## New library layout

```

## Cutover workflow

Cloud API cutover replaces libvirt XML generation.

```text
1. Load manifest and Cloud credentials.
2. Verify final sync is complete.
3. Verify target provider is ablestack-cloud.
4. For every disk:
   - derive Cloud import path
   - call listVolumesForImport(storageid, path)
   - fail if the disk is not visible or is already managed
5. Resolve the disk offering used for imported volumes:
   - if `--cloud-disk-offering-id` is supplied, use that explicit offering ID
   - otherwise query the selected storage pool and choose the n2k-managed
     writeback offering for `shared` or `local` storage
   - create the n2k offering when it does not exist
   - fail if a same-name n2k offering exists but is not active, customized,
     untagged, and `cachemode=writeback`
6. Import root disk:
   - importVolume(storageid, path, name, diskofferingid, account/domain/project)
   - wait for async job
   - record volume ID
7. Deploy VM:
   - deployVirtualMachineForVolume(zoneid, serviceofferingid, volumeid, name, displayname, networkids, hostid, startvm=false)
   - wait for async job
   - record VM ID
8. Ensure the imported root volume is a Cloud ROOT volume:
   - listVolumes(id=<root_volume_id>)
   - if the attached volume is still DATADISK, call updateVolume(id, type=ROOT, path=<import_path>)
   - wait for async job and verify the final type is ROOT
9. Import every data disk:
   - importVolume(...)
   - wait for async job
   - record volume ID
10. Attach every data disk:
   - attachVolume(id, virtualmachineid, deviceid)
   - wait for async job
11. Start VM when requested:
   - startVirtualMachine(id)
   - wait for async job
12. Verify:
   - listVirtualMachines(id)
   - expected state is Running when start was requested
13. Mark cutover phase done.
```

Root disk deployment uses `deployVirtualMachineForVolume`, not the normal `deployVirtualMachine`. The imported root volume is initially a `DATADISK` from `importVolume`. On the current ABLESTACK Cloud build, `deployVirtualMachineForVolume` attaches the imported volume and assigns `deviceId=0` plus the dummy template ID, but may leave `volume_type=DATADISK`. n2k therefore verifies the attached volume with `listVolumes(id=<root_volume_id>)` and, when needed, calls the exposed `updateVolume(id=<root_volume_id>, type=ROOT, path=<import_path>)` API before data-disk attach or VM start. Passing the original import path is required because the current Cloud `updateVolume` implementation can clear the volume path when it is omitted; without the path the KVM agent receives a ROOT volume with `path=null` and fails before libvirt domain creation. If the final volume type is still not `ROOT`, or the root path is empty after conversion, the flow must fail before start.

The ABLESTACK Cloud API currently exposed by `ablestack-diplo` does not publish a `templateid` parameter for `deployVirtualMachineForVolume`. The management-server implementation creates and uses the KVM import dummy template named `kvm-default-vm-import-dummy-template` internally, then assigns that template ID to the imported root volume before VM creation. Therefore n2k does not pass `templateid`; if a future Cloud build exposes the parameter, n2k can add a `--cloud-template-id` option without changing the rest of the import flow.

## N2K disk offering policy

By default, n2k must not rely on ABLESTACK Cloud's implicit `Default Custom
Offering for Volume Import` offering. Instead, when the operator does not supply
`--cloud-disk-offering-id`, n2k owns a visible, Cloud-managed disk offering:

| Storage scope | Offering name | Required properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared storage | `N2K Migration Writeback` | customized, no tags, `storagetype=shared`, `cachemode=writeback` |
| Host-local storage | `N2K Migration Writeback Local` | customized, no tags, `storagetype=local`, `cachemode=writeback` |

The offering is intentionally untagged so it can apply to all storage pools of
the matching Cloud storage type. n2k resolves the target storage pool through
`listStoragePools`, maps host-scoped pools to `local` and every other scope to
`shared`, then calls `listDiskOfferings`. If the matching n2k offering exists and
has the required properties, n2k reuses it. If it does not exist, n2k creates it
with `createDiskOffering(customized=true, provisioningtype=thin,
cachemode=writeback, storagetype=<shared|local>)`.

If an offering with the reserved n2k name and matching storage type already
exists but is not active, is not customized, has tags, or has a cache mode other
than `writeback`, n2k fails before `importVolume`. n2k does not silently repair a
conflicting operator-managed offering. The operator can either correct or delete
the conflicting offering, or intentionally override the behavior with
`--cloud-disk-offering-id`.

After a successful automatic resolve/create, n2k records
`target.cloud.resolved_disk_offering` and the effective
`target.cloud.disk_offering_id` in the manifest. Secrets are not recorded.

## Disk mapping

The manifest already knows disk order and target path.

For RBD:

```text
n2k target path:  rbd:rbd/<image>
Cloud import path: <image>
Cloud full path:   rbd/<image>
```

The first disk in manifest order is the root disk unless an explicit root marker is added later.

Data disks should preserve manifest order:

| Manifest disk index | Cloud role | Cloud attach device ID |
| ---: | --- | ---: |
| 0 | ROOT | 0 through deploy API |
| 1 | DATA | 1 |
| 2 | DATA | 2 |
| N | DATA | N |

CloudStack `attachVolume` supports `deviceid`. n2k should pass it for deterministic multi-disk ordering.

## Network mapping

libvirt mode currently has bridge/network options. Cloud mode must use Cloud network IDs.

Initial design:

- Require at least one `--cloud-network-id`.
- Pass all selected IDs as `networkids`.
- Preserve source MAC only after validating Cloud API accepts `macaddress` for the selected network type.
- For L2 networks, use network ID selection and keep IP preservation out of the first implementation.
- For isolated networks, support static IP later through `iptonetworklist`.

This avoids assuming that libvirt `bridge0` maps directly to a Cloud network.

## Firmware and VM details

Source inventory already captures CPU count, memory size, firmware, secure
boot, and disk controller information where available. Cloud mode must not ask
the operator to re-enter those guest-shape values. It should derive them from
the source VM inventory and pass them to `deployVirtualMachineForVolume`.

Implemented automatic mapping:

| Source inventory field | Cloud API parameter |
| --- | --- |
| `.source.vm.cpu` | `details[0].cpuNumber` |
| `.target.cloud.cpu_speed`, default `1000` | `details[0].cpuSpeed` |
| `.source.vm.memory_mb` | `details[0].memory` |
| `.source.vm.firmware == "efi"` | `boottype=UEFI` |
| `.source.vm.firmware == "bios"` | `boottype=BIOS` |
| `.source.vm.secure_boot == true` with EFI | `bootmode=SECURE` |
| `.source.vm.secure_boot == true` with missing firmware | `boottype=UEFI`, `bootmode=SECURE` |
| EFI without secure boot | `bootmode=LEGACY` |
| BIOS | `bootmode=LEGACY` |
| root disk `.controller.type` | `details[0].rootDiskController` |
| first data disk `.controller.type` | `details[0].dataDiskController` |

Disk controller values are normalized to the Cloud KVM accepted set:
`ide`, `sata`, `scsi`, or `virtio`. Unknown controller strings are not sent,
so the Cloud service offering/template default remains in effect rather than
inventing an unsafe value.

The first migration disk is treated as the root disk. Data disks share the
first observed data-disk controller because the deploy API exposes a VM-level
`dataDiskController` detail rather than a per-volume controller field for this
flow.

TPM, IO threads, IO driver policy, NIC queue tuning, exact source MAC/IP
preservation, and per-data-disk controller overrides remain deferred until the
source inventory and the target Cloud API behavior are validated for those
specific properties.

If the Cloud API rejects one of the derived properties, n2k should record the
Cloud job/API error in the manifest and stop before considering the migration
successful.

## Failure and rollback policy

Cloud operations are asynchronous and may partially succeed. The manifest must record every Cloud object as soon as it is created.

Suggested manifest state:

```json
{
  "target": {
    "cloud": {
      "vm_id": "",
      "imported_volumes": [
        {
          "disk_id": "disk-0",
          "role": "root",
          "path": "image-name",
          "volume_id": "",
          "state": "imported"
        }
      ],
      "jobs": []
    }
  }
}
```

Rollback behavior:

| Failure point | Safe action |
| --- | --- |
| Before import | Leave target disk image in n2k storage cleanup list |
| Root import succeeds, VM not created | `unmanageVolume`, then optional target image cleanup |
| VM created, data attach fails | Stop/destroy VM only with `--force-cleanup` or explicit cleanup command |
| Data volume imported but not attached | `unmanageVolume` |
| VM started but verification fails | Do not destroy automatically; report manual inspection requirement |

`unmanageVolume` removes CloudStack management of a volume without deleting the underlying disk image. Destructive storage deletion should stay in the n2k cleanup command and should require explicit confirmation or cleanup policy.

## Preflight checks

Cloud target preflight should verify:

- Endpoint reachable.
- API key and secret authenticate with `HmacSHA256`.
- API user is admin or has enough permissions.
- Required APIs exist.
- Zone, service offering, network, storage pool, and disk offering resolve.
- Storage pool type is supported by `importVolume`.
- RBD target path uses a Cloud import-compatible image name.
- `listVolumesForImport` can see a known target image after sync.
- Disk size is at least the selected disk offering minimum.

RBD-specific checks:

- `rbd` command works on the migration host.
- Target pool exists.
- Image names are unique.
- Existing image handling is explicit: reuse only with `--resume`; otherwise fail.

## Test plan

### T0: Auth and inventory smoke

Goal: verify signed API requests.

Expected:

- `listZones` succeeds.
- `listApis` includes required APIs.
- `listStoragePools` sees `Primary Storage Glue RBD`.

### T1: RBD import visibility

Goal: verify n2k disk path to Cloud import path mapping.

Steps:

1. Create a 1 GiB temporary RBD image.
2. Call `listVolumesForImport(storageid, path=<image>)`.
3. Confirm `path=<image>`, `fullpath=rbd/<image>`, `format=raw`.
4. Delete the temporary image.

### T2: RBD import/unmanage round trip

Goal: verify Cloud import workflow before VM creation.

Steps:

1. Create a 1 GiB temporary RBD image.
2. `importVolume`.
3. Poll async job.
4. Confirm volume is `Ready`.
5. `unmanageVolume`.
6. Delete RBD image.
7. Confirm `listVolumes` no longer shows the probe volume.

This test already passed manually in the 22.x lab.

### T3: Single-disk Linux VM full migration

Goal: replace libvirt cutover with Cloud VM creation.

Steps:

1. Run n2k full sync to RBD.
2. Cloud cutover with `deployVirtualMachineForVolume`.
3. Start VM.
4. Verify VM state through `listVirtualMachines`.
5. Verify console or guest boot manually.

### T4: Multi-disk VM migration

Goal: verify data disk attach order.

Steps:

1. Migrate a source VM with at least two data disks.
2. Import root disk.
3. Deploy VM.
4. Import and attach data disks with deterministic `deviceid`.
5. Verify all disks appear in Cloud and guest OS.

### T5: Phase1/Phase2 cutover

Goal: verify the existing minimum-downtime sync pipeline with Cloud target cutover.

Steps:

1. Run `--split phase1`.
2. Run `--split phase2`.
3. Perform final sync.
4. Execute Cloud cutover.
5. Verify VM boot and source snapshot cleanup behavior.

## Implementation order

1. Add `cloudstack_api.sh` with SHA256 signing and async job polling.
2. Add read-only `preflight` support for Cloud target resources.
3. Extend manifest schema with `target.provider` and `target.cloud`.
4. Add `target_cloud.sh` import visibility and import/unmanage helpers.
5. Add `cutover --target-provider ablestack-cloud --define-only` equivalent that performs dry-run validation only.
6. Add actual Cloud cutover for root disk only.
7. Add data disk import and attach.
8. Add `run` integration and phase1/phase2 cutover forwarding.
9. Update help and bash completion.
10. Build RPM and run T0-T5 tests.

## Open decisions

| Decision | Proposed default |
| --- | --- |
| Target provider default | `libvirt` for backward compatibility |
| Cloud disk path for RBD | Use image name, not `/rbd/image` |
| Cloud VM start timing | Create stopped first, attach data disks, then start |
| Secret storage | Runtime env or protected credential file only |
| Auto rollback | Conservative; unmanage unattached volumes, do not destroy started VMs automatically |
| Name resolution | Preflight/plan only at first; run/cutover should use UUIDs |

## Summary

ABLESTACK Cloud API target mode is feasible with the current `ablestack-diplo` API surface. The key implementation path is:

```text
RBD/raw target image
  -> listVolumesForImport
  -> importVolume
  -> deployVirtualMachineForVolume
  -> importVolume + attachVolume for data disks
  -> startVirtualMachine
```

This gives n2k a Cloud-managed VM outcome while preserving the existing Nutanix source handling and target disk sync engine.
