# ablestack_n2k v4 API improvement design for PC 10.10.132.100

Date: 2026-05-15  
Environment: Nutanix Prism Central `https://10.10.132.100:9440`

## Purpose

The existing `n2k` implementation has been validated against the older
10.10.131.11 testbed by using v3 VM snapshots, v3 changed regions, and NFS
snapshot files as the data plane. The new 10.10.132.100 environment exists to
validate the official Nutanix v4 path and to prepare `n2k` for newer PC/AOS
releases.

This design keeps the current v3 path as a proven fallback, but adds a first
class v4 source adapter.

## Environment findings

The first probe from the local workstation/WSL reached the Prism Central API and
confirmed that this environment is materially newer than the previous AOS 6.5.2
testbed.

Observed API availability:

| API | Endpoint | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v1 cluster | `/PrismGateway/services/rest/v1/cluster` | HTTP `200` |
| v2 cluster | `/PrismGateway/services/rest/v2.0/cluster` | HTTP `200` |
| v3 clusters | `/api/nutanix/v3/clusters/list` | HTTP `200`, `2` entities |
| v3 VMs | `/api/nutanix/v3/vms/list` | HTTP `200`, `5` entities |
| v4.0 VMM VMs | `/api/vmm/v4.0/ahv/config/vms?$limit=100` | HTTP `200`, `5` VMs |
| v4.1 VMM VMs | `/api/vmm/v4.1/ahv/config/vms?$limit=100` | HTTP `200`, `5` VMs |
| v4.2 VMM VMs | `/api/vmm/v4.2/ahv/config/vms?$limit=100` | HTTP `404` |
| v4.0 Data Protection recovery points | `/api/dataprotection/v4.0/config/recovery-points?$limit=10` | HTTP `200`, `0` recovery points |
| v4.1 Data Protection recovery points | `/api/dataprotection/v4.1/config/recovery-points?$limit=10` | HTTP `200`, `0` recovery points |
| v4.2 Data Protection recovery points | `/api/dataprotection/v4.2/config/recovery-points?$limit=10` | HTTP `404` |
| v4.0 Prism clusters | `/api/prism/v4.0/config/clusters?$limit=100` | HTTP `404` |
| v4.0 Cluster Management clusters | `/api/clustermgmt/v4.0/config/clusters?$limit=100` | HTTP `200`, `2` clusters |

Observed version and cluster signals:

- Prism Central build family: `ganges`
- PC full version observed through v3 cluster list:
  `el8.5-release-ganges-7.3.1.9-stable-pc-bd4b15bc542578ffff1f5a12fe68e1cef3368031`
- NOS version observed through v3 cluster list: `7.3.1.9`
- A PE cluster was visible through v4 cluster management:
  - name: `test-cluster`
  - extId: `000651c1-7bba-d796-4637-020100d40001`
  - node count: `3`

Observed v4 VM inventory:

| VM | Power | Boot | Secure Boot | vCPU shape | Memory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rhel` | `ON` | UEFI | true | `1 x 1` | `4 GiB` |
| `win10` | `ON` | UEFI | true | `4 x 1` | `4 GiB` |
| `centos7-bios-ide` | `ON` | Legacy BIOS | false | `1 x 1` | `4 GiB` |
| `PC-NameOption-1` | `ON` | Legacy BIOS | false | `6 x 1` | `28 GiB` |
| `windows11` | `ON` | UEFI | true | `4 x 1` | `16 GiB` |

Important network finding:

- After the initial successful probe, `10.10.132.100:9440` later returned TCP
  connection refused from the local workstation/WSL.
- The ABLESTACK host `10.10.22.1` also returned connection refused when running
  `ablestack_n2k init` against `10.10.132.100`.
- ICMP ping still succeeded from the workstation, so the host was reachable but
  Prism Gateway on `9440` was not accepting connections at that later check.
- After Prism Gateway was restored, host-side reachability was rechecked on
  2026-05-15. ABLESTACK host `10.10.22.1` could open TCP `9440` to both
  `10.10.132.100` and the legacy PC `10.10.131.11`.

This means v4 support must include both API capability discovery and run-host
connectivity validation. A successful probe from the operator workstation is not
enough for a migration run if the ABLESTACK host executes the source API calls.

## Current implementation gaps

### API revision discovery

Current code probes only fixed v4.0 endpoints:

- `lib/n2k/nutanix_api.sh`
  - `/api/vmm/v4.0/ahv/config/vms?$limit=100`
- `lib/n2k/source_adapter.sh`
  - `/api/vmm/v4.0/ahv/config/vms?$limit=1`
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.0/config/recovery-points?$limit=1`

The new testbed exposes v4.0 and v4.1, but not v4.2. The implementation should
select the highest compatible v4 revision per namespace, then record the chosen
revision in the manifest.

### v4 inventory normalization

The current normalizer can select a v4 VM from `.data[]`, but it does not fully
normalize newer v4 field names.

Required additions:

- firmware:
  - `bootConfig.$objectType == vmm.v4.ahv.config.UefiBoot` -> `efi`
  - `bootConfig.$objectType == vmm.v4.ahv.config.LegacyBoot` -> `bios`
- secure boot:
  - `bootConfig.isSecureBootEnabled`
- vTPM:
  - `vtpmConfig.isVtpmEnabled`
- disk identity and size:
  - `disks[].extId`
  - `disks[].backingInfo.diskExtId`
  - `disks[].backingInfo.diskSizeBytes`
  - `disks[].backingInfo.storageContainer.extId`
  - `disks[].diskAddress.busType`
  - `disks[].diskAddress.index`
- NIC identity:
  - `nics[].backingInfo.macAddress`
  - `nics[].networkInfo.subnet.extId`
  - `nics[].networkInfo.ipv4Config.ipAddress.value`
- CDROM handling:
  - keep using only `disks[]` for migration disks
  - do not treat `cdRoms[]` as migration disks

### v4 capability probing

Current `n2k_source_probe_v4` marks `changed_regions=true` when the Data
Protection recovery point list endpoint returns HTTP 2xx. That is too broad.

The new probe should split capability into:

- `vmm_inventory`: VM list/get works
- `clustermgmt`: cluster list works
- `dp_recovery_points`: recovery point list/create/get APIs are reachable
- `dp_discover_cluster`: PC discover-cluster action is reachable
- `dp_compute_changed_regions`: PE compute-changed-regions action is reachable
- `data_plane`: a usable byte source exists for recovery point disk contents
- `run_host_connectivity`: the actual ABLESTACK host can reach PC and returned
  PE endpoints on port `9440`

Only when all required capability bits are true should `plan` recommend
`v4-incremental`.

### v4 run orchestration

Current `run` supports only:

```text
--source-api v3
```

Required change:

```text
--source-api v4
```

The `v4` flow should mirror the validated v3 flow:

1. create base recovery point
2. build base disk source map
3. sync full disk
4. create incremental recovery point
5. compute changed regions against base
6. patch only changed regions
7. repeat phase2 incremental rounds until deadline criteria are met
8. automatically shut down guest or power off at final cutover boundary
9. create final recovery point
10. compute changed regions against latest incremental reference
11. final patch
12. cutover define/start

## Proposed v4 source adapter design

### API version selection

Add a namespace-aware version resolver:

```text
n2k_nutanix_v4_select_revision <namespace> <pc> <username> <password> <insecure>
```

Initial candidates:

| Namespace | Candidate order |
| --- | --- |
| `vmm` | `v4.1`, `v4.0` |
| `dataprotection` | `v4.1`, `v4.0` |
| `clustermgmt` | `v4.0` |

`v4.2` should be probeable but not preferred until an environment is available
where the endpoint is actually open. The selected revisions should be recorded:

```json
{
  "source": {
    "api": {
      "selected": "v4",
      "v4": {
        "vmm_revision": "v4.1",
        "dataprotection_revision": "v4.1",
        "clustermgmt_revision": "v4.0"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Recovery point creation

Implement:

```text
n2k_source_v4_create_recovery_point
n2k_source_v4_wait_recovery_point
n2k_source_v4_get_recovery_point
n2k_source_v4_delete_recovery_point
```

The SDK documentation exposes `create_recovery_point`, `get_recovery_point_by_id`,
`get_vm_recovery_point_by_id`, and `delete_recovery_point_by_id`. The shell
implementation should use raw REST calls but keep payloads compatible with the
documented model names.

The manifest must normalize:

- top-level recovery point extId
- VM recovery point extId
- disk recovery point extId per VM disk
- recovery point creation time and expiration time
- source VM extId
- disk extId and disk size

### Changed regions

Official v4 changed-region retrieval is a two-step operation:

1. PC discover-cluster action for a recovery point operation.
2. PE compute-changed-regions action using the JWT returned by the first call.

Implement:

```text
n2k_source_v4_discover_changed_regions_cluster
n2k_source_v4_compute_changed_regions
n2k_source_v4_collect_changed_regions
```

The PC call should use operation `COMPUTE_CHANGED_REGIONS`. The PE call should
use the returned PE IP and send the JWT as:

```text
Cookie: NTNX_IGW_SESSION=<jwt>
```

The collector must support pagination/streaming:

- request `offset`, `length`, and `blockSizeByte`
- collect up to the server limit
- read `nextOffset` from response metadata
- continue until `nextOffset` is absent or `0`
- preserve zero-region markers so the writer can skip or punch holes

### Data plane

Changed-region metadata alone is not enough; `n2k` also needs bytes for the
base disk and changed regions.

Design decision:

- Treat v4 changed regions as the metadata/control plane.
- Add a separate v4-compatible data-plane capability bit.
- Prefer an official v4 recovery point disk content/export API if it is
  confirmed in the environment.
- If no official byte-stream endpoint is available, use one of these data-plane
  options behind a clearly named adapter:
  - recovery point clone/proxy VM hotplug
  - PE/CVM snapshot file access
  - existing v3/NFS source map if the v4 recovery point can be correlated to a
    readable container path

The plan must not report `v4-incremental` as fully runnable until both metadata
and data-plane paths are verified.

### Run-host connectivity preflight

Add a preflight command path that can run from the ABLESTACK host context:

```text
ablestack_n2k preflight --pc 10.10.132.100 --source-api v4 --check-connectivity
```

Required checks:

- PC `9440` reachable from the host where `n2k` runs
- selected PE `9440` reachable from the same host after discover-cluster
- NFS or clone/proxy data-plane endpoint reachable if used
- authentication failure reported separately from connection failure
- timeout configured, so a down Prism Gateway does not hang `init`

The 10.10.132.100 testbed showed why this matters: v4 endpoints were initially
available from the workstation, but later `9440` refused connections, and
`10.10.22.1` could not use the PC as a source endpoint during `init`.

## Implementation phases

## Implementation update - 2026-05-15

Implemented the safe foundation for Phase A and part of Phase B:

- v4 namespace revision selection now prefers `v4.1` and falls back to `v4.0`
  for VMM and Data Protection.
- Cluster Management v4 probing uses `v4.0`.
- API calls now have configurable curl timeout guards:
  - `N2K_NUTANIX_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, default `10`
  - `N2K_NUTANIX_MAX_TIME`, default `120`
- v4 VM inventory normalization supports the observed Ganges/AOS 7.3 field
  layout:
  - `bootConfig.$objectType`
  - `bootConfig.isSecureBootEnabled`
  - `vtpmConfig.isVtpmEnabled`
  - `disks[].backingInfo.diskExtId`
  - `disks[].backingInfo.diskSizeBytes`
  - `disks[].backingInfo.storageContainer.extId`
  - `nics[].backingInfo.macAddress`
  - `nics[].networkInfo.subnet.extId`
- v4 probe output records selected namespace revisions and HTTP probe status.
- v2/v3 fallback order is preserved after v4 attempts.
- `plan` now requires a verified v4 recovery-point data plane before treating
  `v4-incremental` as runnable. The CLI includes `--v4-data-plane <0|1>` only
  as an explicit fixture/test override.

Validation results:

- Legacy PC `10.10.131.11` API inventory smoke still passed for `rhel`.
- v4 PC `10.10.132.100` API inventory smoke passed for `rhel`.
- v4 PC selected revisions:
  - VMM: `v4.1`
  - Data Protection: `v4.1`
  - Cluster Management: `v4.0`
- v4 fixture smoke covers UEFI secure boot and Legacy BIOS VM inventory shapes.
- Host-side connectivity from `10.10.22.1` to `10.10.132.100:9440` and
  `10.10.131.11:9440` passed.
- Full PC `10.10.132.100` inventory matrix passed with `init --inventory-source api`:

| VM | Firmware | Secure Boot | vTPM | CPU | Memory MiB | Disks | First Bus | First Size Bytes | NICs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rhel` | `efi` | true | false | 1 | 4096 | 1 | SCSI | 107374182400 | 1 |
| `win10` | `efi` | true | false | 4 | 4096 | 1 | SCSI | 107374182400 | 1 |
| `centos7-bios-ide` | `bios` | false | false | 1 | 4096 | 1 | IDE | 107374182400 | 1 |
| `PC-NameOption-1` | `bios` | false | false | 6 | 28672 | 7 | SCSI | 15728640 | 2 |
| `windows11` | `efi` | true | true | 4 | 16384 | 1 | SCSI | 107374182400 | 1 |

- PC `10.10.132.100` plan matrix detected v4 VMM, Data Protection, Cluster
  Management, and changed-region control-plane availability on all observed VMs,
  with revisions `v4.1`, `v4.1`, and `v4.0`. Because the v4 data plane is still
  `false`, automatic planning selected `manual-disk`, and explicit
  `--mode v4-incremental` returned `can_run=false`.

Additional Recovery Point PoC results:

- Data Protection v4 create/delete requests require `NTNX-Request-Id`.
- `POST /api/dataprotection/v4.1/config/recovery-points` accepted the minimal
  VM Recovery Point payload:
  - `name`
  - `expirationTime`
  - `vmRecoveryPoints[].vmExtId`
- Create and delete both return Prism task references. The create task's
  `completionDetails` includes `recoveryPointExtId`, which is more reliable than
  resolving the new Recovery Point by list/name.
- `GET /api/dataprotection/v4.1/config/recovery-points/{extId}` works.
- `GET /api/dataprotection/v4.1/config/recovery-points/{rpExtId}/vm-recovery-points/{vmRpExtId}`
  works.
- A live `rhel` Recovery Point produced:
  - top-level Recovery Point extId
  - VM Recovery Point extId
  - three disk recovery point identifiers
  - source VM disk correlation for the primary vDisk through `diskExtId`
- Delete cleanup completed successfully through the returned delete task.

Additional changed-region PoC results:

- PC `discover-cluster` works for `COMPUTE_CHANGED_REGIONS` when the request body
  includes:
  - top-level `$objectType`:
    `dataprotection.v4.content.ClusterDiscoverSpec`
  - `spec.$objectType`:
    `dataprotection.v4.content.ComputeChangedRegionsClusterDiscoverSpec`
  - VM disk references with `$objectType`:
    `dataprotection.v4.content.VmDiskRecoveryPointReference`
- PC `10.10.132.100` returned PE `10.10.132.10`, a JWT, and a redirection link
  for the PE compute call.
- The PE compute call is not yet runnable in this environment:
  - v4.1 discover returns a v4.1 redirection URL, but the JWT scope is
    `/api/dataprotection/v4.0/content`; PE returns HTTP `401` with
    `Scope claim value does not match API base path`.
  - v4.0 discover returns a v4.0 redirection URL with matching JWT scope, but PE
    returns HTTP `404` for the v4.0 content endpoint.
- Therefore `data_plane=false` remains correct, and `v4-incremental` must stay
  blocked until the PE content API revision/scope mismatch is resolved.

The run data plane for official v4 recovery points remains an open item. The
current implementation improves API detection, inventory, and path selection,
while deliberately blocking v4 incremental runs until recovery-point disk bytes
are verified. The already validated v3/NFS source path remains the runnable
migration path.

### Phase A - Safe v4 inventory readiness

Deliverables:

- v4 revision resolver
- v4.1-aware VM inventory fetch
- v4 inventory normalizer field additions
- fixtures captured from the 10.10.132.100 environment
- unit tests for:
  - UEFI secure boot VM
  - Legacy BIOS VM
  - nested v4 disk size and storage container fields
  - nested v4 NIC MAC/subnet fields

Acceptance:

- `init --inventory-source api` works for `rhel`, `win10`,
  `centos7-bios-ide`, and `windows11` when PC `9440` is reachable.
- Manifest disks have non-zero `size_bytes`.
- UEFI and secure boot are detected from v4 fields.
- CDROM entries are excluded.

### Phase B - v4 capability and preflight accuracy

Deliverables:

- capability JSON separates VMM, DP list/create, changed-region discover,
  changed-region compute, data plane, and run-host connectivity
- `plan` recommends `v4-incremental` only when all required bits are true
- timeout and error classification for refused/unreachable PC

Acceptance:

- 10.10.132.100 reports v4 VMM/DP available when service is up.
- If `9440` is refused, `plan` returns a connection failure and chooses a safe
  fallback or blocked state instead of hanging.
- The previous 10.10.131.11 environment still falls back to v3/v2 inventory.

### Phase C - v4 recovery point PoC

Deliverables:

- create/list/get/delete recovery point through v4 Data Protection
- recovery point manifest model
- cleanup safety for test recovery points

Acceptance:

- base and incremental recovery points can be created for a small test VM.
- Each VM disk maps to a v4 disk recovery point extId.
- Recovery points are cleaned up or expire according to policy.

Status: implemented and live-validated for `rhel` on PC `10.10.132.100`.

### Phase D - v4 changed-region PoC

Deliverables:

- PC discover-cluster action
- PE compute-changed-regions action
- JWT cookie handling
- pagination/streaming collector
- normalized changed-region schema reused by the existing patch writer

Acceptance:

- base recovery point alone returns full changed-region coverage.
- incremental recovery point against base returns only changed regions.
- zero-region metadata is preserved.

Status: PC discover-cluster is live-validated. PE compute is blocked by the
observed JWT scope/API revision mismatch and remains open.

Additional validation on 2026-05-16:

- A new `rhel` recovery point was created and cleaned up through v4.1.
- PC `discover-cluster` succeeded for `v4.1`, `v4.0`, and `v4.0.b1`.
- Every successful discover response returned PE `10.10.132.10`.
- The returned JWT scope was consistently:
  `/api/dataprotection/v4.0/content`
- PE compute path results:
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.1/content/.../$actions/compute-changed-regions`
    returned HTTP `401`, `Scope claim value does not match API base path`.
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.0/content/.../$actions/compute-changed-regions`
    returned HTTP `404`.
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.0.b1/content/.../$actions/compute-changed-regions`
    returned HTTP `401`, also due API base path/scope mismatch.
- The code now decodes the discover JWT scope and prefers that content revision
  for the PE compute call. This makes newer or correctly aligned environments
  runnable without hard-coding the PC config API revision as the PE content API
  revision.
- Because this testbed still returns `v4.0` scope with no matching PE content
  route, `data_plane=false` and v4 incremental blocking remain correct for
  PC132.

Endpoint variant validation on 2026-05-16:

- PC `config` list endpoints remain reachable:
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.0/config/recovery-points?$limit=1` -> HTTP `200`
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.1/config/recovery-points?$limit=1` -> HTTP `200`
- PE `10.10.132.10` does not expose generic v4 Data Protection list roots:
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.0/content` -> HTTP `404`
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.1/content` -> HTTP `404`
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.0/config/recovery-points?$limit=1` -> HTTP `404`
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.1/config/recovery-points?$limit=1` -> HTTP `404`
- Exact PE compute endpoint variants were tested with a live `rhel` recovery
  point and then cleaned up:
  - v4.0 `$actions` and `%24actions` paths -> HTTP `404`
  - v4.1 `$actions` path -> HTTP `401`, scope/base-path mismatch
  - paths without `/api` -> HTTP `404`
  - paths without `$actions` -> HTTP `404`
  - `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` on v4.1 -> HTTP `403`
  - lowercase `cookie` header behaves the same as `Cookie`
  - PC content POST on the v4.0 compute path -> HTTP `501`
- Current conclusion: this is not a shell URL escaping or header casing bug in
  `n2k`. PC132 returns a JWT scoped to `v4.0` content while the PE only shows a
  routable compute action at the `v4.1` base path, where the JWT is rejected.
  Treat this as an environment/product API alignment issue unless Nutanix
  provides a different supported PE content endpoint or cluster setting.
- `n2k_source_probe_v4` now reports v4 recovery point config APIs separately
  from changed-region compute/data-plane readiness. A reachable recovery point
  list endpoint no longer implies `changed_regions=true`.

PE v4 namespace validation on 2026-05-16:

- The PE returned by PC `discover-cluster` for changed-region compute is
  `10.10.132.10`.
- That PE accepts Prism Element legacy and v3 APIs:
  - `/PrismGateway/services/rest/v1/cluster` -> HTTP `200`
  - `/PrismGateway/services/rest/v2.0/cluster` -> HTTP `200`
  - `/api/nutanix/v3/clusters/list` -> HTTP `200`
  - `/api/nutanix/v3/vms/list` -> HTTP `200`
- The same PE does not expose the tested v4 namespaces:
  - `/api/vmm/v4.1/ahv/config/vms` -> HTTP `404`
  - `/api/vmm/v4.0/ahv/config/vms` -> HTTP `404`
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.1/config/recovery-points` -> HTTP `404`
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.0/config/recovery-points` -> HTTP `404`
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.1/content` -> HTTP `404`
  - `/api/dataprotection/v4.0/content` -> HTTP `404`
  - `/api/clustermgmt/v4.0/config/clusters` -> HTTP `404`
  - `/api/prism/v4.0/config/tasks` -> HTTP `404`
- Exact PE compute route probes with bogus IDs also returned HTTP `404` for
  `v4.1`, `v4.0`, and `v4.0.b1`.
- By contrast, PC `10.10.132.100` exposes v4 VMM, Data Protection config,
  Cluster Management, and Prism task APIs with HTTP `200`.
- Conclusion: the changed-region compute failure is very likely caused by the
  discovered PE not exposing/accepting v4 API namespaces, not by request
  escaping or client-side routing in `n2k`. The previous v4.1 JWT `401` should
  be treated as an auth/scope filter result before a usable PE v4 content route
  is available, because direct PE route probing shows the API route itself is
  not exposed.

v3 fallback routing update on 2026-05-16:

- When PC exposes v4 APIs but the PE does not expose v4 content/compute routes,
  `n2k` must not remain on `manual-disk` only. It should prefer the already
  validated v3 incremental path when the hosting PE supports it.
- PC132 itself returns HTTP `404` for the internal v3 VM snapshot and
  `/api/nutanix/v3/data/changed_regions` endpoints, but the discovered PE
  `10.10.132.10` returns:
  - `/api/nutanix/v3/vm_snapshots/list` -> HTTP `200`
  - `/api/nutanix/v3/data/changed_regions` with an empty body -> HTTP `422`,
    which confirms the endpoint exists and requires a valid snapshot path
    payload
  - `/api/nutanix/v3/vms/list` -> HTTP `200`
- `n2k_source_probe_capabilities` now probes v3 source endpoint candidates:
  - the provided PC endpoint
  - AOS cluster external IPs discovered from v3 cluster list
  - AOS cluster external addresses discovered from v4 Cluster Management
- A v3 source endpoint is selected only when it supports VM snapshots,
  changed-region endpoint probing, and the source VM is visible on that
  endpoint.
- `preflight` and `plan` now expose a first-class `v3-incremental` mode. On the
  current PC132 state, automatic planning selects:

```text
selected_mode: v3-incremental
source_endpoint: 10.10.132.10
```

- `run --source-api v3` now reuses the same endpoint selection and sends v3
  snapshot/changed-region API calls, plus the NFS source-map host default, to
  the selected PE instead of blindly using the PC address.

Explicit v3 operator override on 2026-05-16:

- Operators can force the v3 incremental route even when PC advertises a fully
  usable v4 route.
- Supported selectors:
  - `preflight|plan --force-v3`
  - `preflight|plan --source-api v3`
  - `run --force-v3`
  - `run --source-api v3` when the option is explicitly provided
  - `--mode v3-incremental` remains the direct mode selector
- A forced v3 selection records `source_api_policy: v3`, `mode_forced: true`,
  and `forced_mode: v3-incremental` in preflight/plan output and the manifest
  preflight block.
- If `--force-v3` or explicit `--source-api v3` is combined with a conflicting
  mode such as `--mode v4-incremental`, the command fails fast instead of
  silently overriding the operator input.

Byte-source validation on 2026-05-16:

- Officially visible v4 Data Protection APIs expose Recovery Point config
  operations and changed-region/VSS metadata operations, but no direct Recovery
  Point disk byte-stream or disk download operation was found in the referenced
  SDK/API pages.
- The documented v4 CBT/CRT flow returns changed-region metadata. It identifies
  changed offsets and lengths, but it does not provide the corresponding disk
  bytes needed by `n2k` writers.
- PC132 live probe against `rhel` confirmed that v4 VM and disk identities are
  visible:
  - VM extId: `c571852a-43ab-42e4-a58b-a5e38a459b06`
  - disk extId: `ae29c318-5dca-44b3-93c6-f3f3714177ec`
- Direct v4 disk byte/export candidates are not available on PC132:
  - `/api/vmm/v4.1/ahv/config/vms/{vmExtId}/disks/{diskExtId}/data` -> HTTP
    `404`
  - `/api/vmm/v4.1/ahv/content/vms/{vmExtId}/disks/{diskExtId}/data` -> HTTP
    `404`
  - `/api/vmm/v4.1/ahv/content/vms/{vmExtId}/disks/{diskExtId}/$actions/export`
    -> HTTP `404`
  - the same v4.0 endpoint variants also returned HTTP `404`
- The same VM's legacy v3 live disk data endpoint returned HTTP `200` with
  `application/octet-stream`, proving the account, VM selection, and network
  path were valid during the probe. The missing result is specific to the v4
  direct byte-source candidates.
- Top-level Recovery Point restore and replicate action routes appear to exist:
  - bogus Recovery Point restore POST returned HTTP `404` with a Recovery Point
    not found message, which means the route was parsed.
  - bogus Recovery Point replicate POST returned HTTP `400` asking for `pcExtId`,
    which means schema validation was reached.
- A restore-to-temporary-VM approach is therefore the only currently visible v4
  data-plane candidate. It is not enabled in code because it creates or modifies
  Nutanix VM state and needs an explicit destructive/live restore test,
  post-restore byte-source selection, and cleanup policy.
- `n2k_source_probe_v4` now reports `byte_source=false` and structured
  byte-source candidate fields separately from `changed_regions` and
  `data_plane`.
- Current conclusion: keep v4 `data_plane=false` on PC132. The validated v3
  source path remains the runnable E2E path until a supported v4 byte source is
  confirmed or restore-to-temporary-VM is deliberately validated.

Restore-to-temporary-VM adapter design on 2026-05-16:

- The SDK exposes `restore_recovery_point(extId, body)` with a
  `RecoveryPointRestorationSpec` body.
- The body supports `vmRecoveryPointRestoreOverrides[]`, and each VM override can
  include:
  - `vmRecoveryPointExtId`
  - `isStrictMode`
  - `vmOverrideSpec`
- For AHV, `vmOverrideSpec` can be an `AhvVmOverrideSpec`, which includes a
  replacement VM name. This is the safe way to avoid overwriting or colliding
  with the source VM during a byte-source validation restore.
- `n2k` now has a shell helper that builds this body and posts to:

```text
/api/dataprotection/{revision}/config/recovery-points/{rpExtId}/$actions/restore
```

- The CLI surface is intentionally gated:
  - `snapshot ... --source-api v4 --create-recovery-point --restore-to-temp-vm`
    requires global `--force`.
  - `--dry-run` can render the intended metadata without creating a Nutanix VM.
  - `--temp-vm-name` sets the restored VM name; otherwise `n2k` generates an
    `n2k-restore-*` name.
  - `--restore-cluster-id` can pin the restore target cluster extId when the
    default Recovery Point location is not sufficient.
- A completed restore records the restore response, restore task, temporary VM
  name, and temporary VM extId in the manifest under:

```text
runtime.recovery_points.<kind>.metadata.v4.restore_to_temp_vm
```

- This still does not mark v4 `byte_source=true` or `data_plane=true`. The next
  validation must prove which API or host-side access path can read bytes from
  the restored temporary VM disk and must also prove cleanup of that temporary
  VM.

Live restore validation on 2026-05-16:

- A live `rhel` Recovery Point restore was attempted with a generated temporary
  VM name. PC132 returned a top-level restore task and a VM restore subtask, but
  both ended in `FAILED`:
  - top-level error: `DP-10000`, `DATAPROTECTION_INTERNAL_ERROR`
  - VM subtask error: `VMM-10000` and `DP-10000`
- Even with the failed task status, PC132 created an `OFF` temporary VM with one
  100 GiB disk.
- The temporary VM's v4 direct byte-source candidates still failed:
  - v4.1 config disk data path -> HTTP `404`
  - v4.1 content disk data path -> HTTP `404`
- The temporary VM appeared in the v3 VM list, and its v3 live disk data endpoint
  returned HTTP `200` with `application/octet-stream`.
- The first 512 bytes read through the v3 live disk data endpoint matched the
  source `rhel` disk byte-for-byte in the validation run.
- Creating a v3 internal VM snapshot for the temporary VM failed with HTTP
  `404`, so the restore-to-temp-VM path has not yet produced a full NFS-backed
  byte source.
- Cleanup details:
  - v4 VM deletion requires an `ETag` from VM GET and `If-Match` on DELETE.
  - Temporary VM delete task completed with `SUCCEEDED`.
  - Recovery Point delete task completed with `SUCCEEDED`.
- Code was adjusted to wait for a terminal restore task state and record the
  temporary VM identity even when the restore task status is `FAILED`. This
  prevents failed restore attempts from hiding orphaned temporary VM details.

v3 live disk data limit validation on 2026-05-16:

- PC132 `rhel` v3 live disk data endpoint was probed with the primary 12.5 GiB
  disk.
- Successful reads:
  - `offset=0,length=512`
  - `offset=512,length=512`
  - `offset=1048576,length=512`
  - `offset=16777216,length=512`
  - `offset=0,length=1048576`
  - `offset=0,length=16777216`
- Rejected reads returned HTTP `422`:
  - `offset=16777728,length=512`
  - `offset=67108864,length=512`
  - `offset=1073741824,length=512`
  - last 512 bytes of the 12.5 GiB disk
  - `offset=0,length=16777728`
- Conclusion: the v3 live disk data API is useful as a small-window validation
  read path, but not as a full-disk byte source for v4 restore-to-temp-VM. The
  existing `N2K_NUTANIX_DATA_OFFSET_MAX` and `N2K_NUTANIX_DATA_LENGTH_MAX`
  defaults of `16777216` remain correct.
- `n2k_source_probe_v4` now reports
  `byte_source_candidates.restore_to_temp_vm_v3_live_data=false` with the
  observed limits, so a restored temporary VM is not accidentally promoted to a
  runnable v4 data plane.

Revalidation after corrected target on 2026-05-18:

- The current v4 target is Prism Central `https://10.10.132.100:9440`; the
  earlier 10.10.131.x check was against the wrong environment for this work.
- PC `10.10.132.100` is reachable and exposes the expected v4 PC-side
  namespaces:
  - VMM `v4.1` -> HTTP `200`, `5` VMs
  - VMM `v4.0` -> HTTP `200`, `5` VMs
  - VMM `v4.2` -> HTTP `404`
  - Data Protection config recovery points `v4.1` -> HTTP `200`
  - Data Protection config recovery points `v4.0` -> HTTP `200`
  - Data Protection `v4.2` -> HTTP `404`
  - Cluster Management clusters `v4.1` -> HTTP `200`, `2` clusters
  - Cluster Management clusters `v4.0` -> HTTP `200`, `2` clusters
  - Prism tasks `v4.1` -> HTTP `200`
  - Prism tasks `v4.0` -> HTTP `200`
- PC version observed through v1/v2 compatibility APIs is `pc.7.3.1.9`.
- PC v3 compatibility APIs also remain available:
  - `/api/nutanix/v3/clusters/list` -> HTTP `200`, `2` entities
  - `/api/nutanix/v3/vms/list` -> HTTP `200`, `5` entities
  - `/api/nutanix/v3/vm_snapshots/list` -> HTTP `404` on PC, so v3 snapshot
    operations must still be routed to the hosting PE when using fallback.
- The AOS PE cluster discovered from PC is:
  - name: `test-cluster`
  - extId/UUID: `000651c1-7bba-d796-4637-020100d40001`
  - external IP: `10.10.132.10`
  - external data services IP from v3 cluster list: `10.10.132.9`
  - AOS version: `7.3.1.5`
  - node count: `3`
- Current v4 VM inventory from PC:

| VM | Power | Disks | NICs | Cluster |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rhel` | `OFF` | `3` | `1` | `test-cluster` |
| `win10` | `OFF` | `2` | `1` | `test-cluster` |
| `centos7-bios-ide` | `OFF` | `1` | `1` | `test-cluster` |
| `PC-NameOption-1` | `ON` | `7` | `2` | `test-cluster` |
| `windows11` | `ON` | `1` | `1` | `test-cluster` |

- Direct PE probe against `https://10.10.132.10:9440` shows that the PE is
  upgraded to AOS `7.3.1.5` and legacy/v3 source APIs are still usable:
  - v1/v2 cluster APIs -> HTTP `200`
  - `/api/nutanix/v3/vms/list` -> HTTP `200`, `5` VMs
  - `/api/nutanix/v3/vm_snapshots/list` -> HTTP `200`, `0` snapshots
  - `/api/nutanix/v3/data/changed_regions` with an empty body -> HTTP `422`,
    confirming the endpoint exists and expects a valid snapshot path payload.
- The same direct PE probe still returns HTTP `404` for the tested v4
  namespaces:
  - VMM `v4.1` and `v4.0`
  - Data Protection config `v4.1` and `v4.0`
  - Data Protection content roots `v4.1`, `v4.0`, and `v4.0.b1`
  - Cluster Management `v4.1` and `v4.0`
  - Prism tasks `v4.1` and `v4.0`

Design impact from the 2026-05-18 revalidation:

- PC-side v4 inventory, Recovery Point config, Cluster Management, and Prism
  task APIs are available and should be treated as the preferred control-plane
  candidate when `source_api_policy=auto`.
- Namespace revision selection should be updated to prefer `v4.1` for Cluster
  Management and Prism tasks as well as VMM/Data Protection, while keeping
  `v4.0` fallback and treating `v4.2` as unavailable on this testbed.
- PE direct v4 namespace probes are still not enough to mark changed-region
  compute or byte-source data-plane capabilities as runnable. The implementation
  must keep the current capability split:
  - `dp_recovery_points=true` from PC config API
  - `dp_discover_cluster` only after a live Recovery Point discover smoke
  - `dp_compute_changed_regions` only after a live PE redirected compute smoke
  - `byte_source=false` until a supported byte stream or validated restore
    data-plane is proven
- Automatic run selection must keep the verified v3 PE fallback path when PC is
  v4-capable but the PE v4 content/data-plane path is not proven. For this
  environment that means routing runnable E2E migrations to PE `10.10.132.10`
  through v3 snapshot/changed-region APIs until the v4 content path passes.
- The next validation step before enabling `run --source-api v4` is a controlled
  live smoke:
  1. create a short-retention v4 Recovery Point on a small test VM,
  2. wait through the selected Prism task API,
  3. resolve Recovery Point, VM Recovery Point, and disk Recovery Point IDs,
  4. call PC `discover-cluster`,
  5. execute the returned PE compute-changed-regions URL with the returned JWT,
  6. delete the Recovery Point even on failure.

Controlled live changed-region smoke on 2026-05-18:

- Target VM: `centos7-bios-ide`
  - VM extId: `92c03e06-e400-40f1-b000-e9be3b0c92b1`
  - power state: `OFF`
  - disk count: `1`
- Selected PC-side revisions:
  - VMM: `v4.1`
  - Data Protection config: `v4.1`
  - Cluster Management: `v4.0`
- A short-retention v4 Recovery Point was created through PC
  `10.10.132.100` and the Prism task completed with `SUCCEEDED`.
- Resolved identifiers:
  - Recovery Point extId: `cca07175-9f57-4301-9c59-134cd60ef1a6`
  - VM Recovery Point extId: `0008c8c5-18c0-4409-afcf-0a392f4b7e7b`
  - Disk Recovery Point extId: `d0061823-ab02-4e05-9b61-7673c2797a34`
- PC `discover-cluster` succeeded and returned:
  - PE IP: `10.10.132.10`
  - JWT scope/content revision: `v4.0`
  - compute path:
    `/api/dataprotection/v4.0/content/recovery-points/{rp}/vm-recovery-points/{vmrp}/disk-recovery-points/{diskrp}/$actions/compute-changed-regions`
- PE `compute-changed-regions` succeeded with HTTP `200` when called through
  the exact path returned/derived from the discover JWT scope.
  - request window: `offset=0`, `length=1048576`, `blockSizeByte=32768`
  - returned region count: `2`
  - returned `nextOffset`: `1048576`
  - returned `fileSize`: `107374182400`
- Cleanup succeeded:
  - Recovery Point delete task status: `SUCCEEDED`
  - follow-up Recovery Point list found no remaining `n2k-v4-smoke-*`
    Recovery Points.

Design impact from the live smoke:

- The direct PE v4 namespace root probes returning HTTP `404` do not mean the
  redirected PE content action is unavailable. The exact JWT-authorized
  `compute-changed-regions` action can still succeed.
- `n2k` should rely on the PC `discover-cluster` response and JWT scope to
  choose the PE content revision/path, instead of probing generic PE v4 roots or
  forcing the PC config revision onto PE content calls.
- The v4 changed-region metadata/control-plane capability is now proven for a
  single-disk VM and a no-reference/base-style changed-region window on PC132.
- Remaining v4 run blockers are now narrower:
  - confirm incremental comparison between two Recovery Points,
  - confirm pagination across all regions/disks,
  - confirm a reliable byte-source data plane for copying the changed bytes.

### Phase E - v4 data-plane and E2E

Deliverables:

- confirmed byte source for v4 recovery point disk contents
- `run --source-api v4 --split phase1/phase2/full`
- RBD, qcow2, and block/LVM target coverage reusing the already validated target
  adapters

Acceptance:

- `rhel` v4 Phase1/Phase2 E2E passes.
- one Windows VM v4 Phase1/Phase2 E2E passes.
- one full one-shot v4 E2E passes.
- v3 fallback remains functional.

## Open items

1. Keep Prism Gateway on `10.10.132.100:9440` under observation during live
   testing. It recovered and passed host-side connectivity checks, but earlier
   probes saw TCP connection refused.
2. Repeat host-side reachability checks from `10.10.22.2` and `10.10.22.3`
   before using either host for v4 source operations. `10.10.22.1` has already
   reached `10.10.132.100:9440` successfully.
3. Confirm the official or supported byte-stream data plane for v4 recovery
   point disks. Changed-region APIs identify what changed, but `n2k` still needs
   a reliable way to read the corresponding bytes.
4. Extend the successful PC132 changed-region smoke:
   - create two Recovery Points and compute changed regions with a real
     reference Recovery Point.
   - verify pagination until `nextOffset=0` across all disks.
   - run the same check on `rhel` and `win10`, which have multiple disks in the
     current testbed.
5. Implement v4.1-first revision selection for Cluster Management and Prism
   tasks, matching the already preferred v4.1 VMM/Data Protection behavior.
