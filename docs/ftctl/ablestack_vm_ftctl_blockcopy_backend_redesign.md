# ablestack_vm_ftctl Blockcopy Backend Redesign

## 1. Purpose

This document formalizes the HA/DR backend redesign discovered during real-environment testing.

The original implementation proved that control-plane orchestration could:

- collect inventory
- start a libvirt blockcopy mirror
- generate standby XML
- define persistent standby domains

However, real-environment validation showed that the current blockcopy target model is not sufficient for host-local, non-shared storage.

## 2. Problem Statement

Observed behavior:

- runtime `virsh dumpxml` on the primary host showed a valid `<mirror ...>` element
- the mirror target path was still a primary-host local filesystem path
- the secondary host did not receive a usable replica disk
- failover-ready standby storage was therefore not guaranteed

Implication:

- a runtime XML mirror element on the primary host is not enough to declare HA/DR success
- the data plane must prepare a storage target that the secondary host can actually use

## 3. Required Backend Split

HA/DR blockcopy must be split into at least two backend modes.

### 3.1 `shared-visible blockcopy mode`

Use this mode when:

- primary and secondary hosts can both access the target storage path
- storage is shared or otherwise visible from both sides
- the target path is valid for both replication and later standby activation

Examples:

- shared NFS
- shared multipath-backed filesystem
- storage systems where both hosts can access the same replicated target path
- shared RBD exposed as KRBD paths such as `/dev/rbd/rbd/<image>`

Behavior:

1. primary starts `blockcopy` to a shared-visible target path
2. standby XML is generated for the secondary host
3. the secondary domain is defined with a distinct standby domain name
4. failover starts the secondary domain against the shared-visible target path

Notes:

- the primary and secondary domain names should not be identical on the same cluster
- service identity and domain identity should be separated

Recommended fields:

- `service_id`
- `primary_domain_name`
- `secondary_domain_name`
- `target_storage_scope=shared`

### 3.2 `remote-local transport mode`

Use this mode when:

- primary and secondary hosts do not share storage
- the destination must live on the secondary host local storage
- the hosts may be in different sites

Examples:

- local file qcow2 on each host
- local raw file on each host
- remote DR host without shared storage

Behavior:

1. secondary prepares a local target file or block device
2. secondary exports that target through a remote transport such as NBD
3. primary mirrors to that remote sink
4. standby XML on the secondary host references the secondary-local path
5. failover activates the secondary domain against its local replica

Notes:

- simple primary-local filesystem paths are invalid for this mode
- plain local `virsh blockcopy` destination paths must not be used as a substitute for remote replication

Recommended fields:

- `target_storage_scope=secondary-local`
- `transport_mode=remote-nbd`
- `secondary_target_dir`
- `secondary_target_path`
- `secondary_export_addr`
- `secondary_export_port`
- `secondary_export_name`

## 4. Validation Rules

The controller must validate backend assumptions before `protect`.

### 4.1 Reject unsupported layouts

The controller must reject:

- local file backend
- local block backend
- non-shared storage

Reason:

- this would create a primary-local mirror target instead of a usable secondary-side replica

### 4.2 Accept shared-visible layouts

The controller may accept:

- shared paths visible from both hosts
- target paths explicitly marked as shared-visible
- KRBD shared RBD targets when both hosts can access the same RBD image

### 4.3 Accept remote-local transport layouts

The controller may accept:

- secondary-local storage
- remote transport settings fully provided
- remote sink reachability validated before `protect`

## 5. Runtime Success Criteria

`blockjob --info` alone is not a sufficient success signal in every libvirt/QEMU environment.

Protect success should be judged from multiple signals:

- runtime XML mirror metadata in `virsh dumpxml`
- target path storage scope validation
- actual target existence on the correct host
- materialization verification that proves the target contains copied data
- secondary standby XML correctness
- secondary domain define/create readiness

For shared RBD/KRBD targets, QMP or runtime XML `ready=yes` is not enough. After blockcopy reports ready, FTCTL must verify the target RBD is not empty when the source contains data and that the target head sample matches the source head sample before declaring `protected/mirroring`.

For non-shared local storage, success requires:

- target exists on the secondary side
- standby XML references the secondary-local target
- the failover path can boot from the secondary-local replica

## 6. Test Matrix Impact

The real-environment test matrix must be interpreted with backend-awareness.

### 6.1 Reclassified tests

- `HA-IMG01-ST01`: failed as a true HA data-plane test under current implementation
- `HA-IMG08-ST01`: failed as a true HA data-plane test under current implementation

Reason:

- both tests used local file qcow2 without a valid secondary-side data-plane replica

### 6.2 New expectation

Before re-running local-storage HA/DR tests, the implementation must support:

- `remote-local transport mode`

Shared-storage tests may continue under:

- `shared-visible blockcopy mode`

## 7. Next Implementation Tasks

1. Add backend mode fields to profile schema
2. Add validation that rejects invalid storage/layout combinations
3. Implement `remote-local transport mode` for non-shared local storage
4. Separate service identity from standby domain name
5. Update real-environment test IDs and expectations by backend mode
