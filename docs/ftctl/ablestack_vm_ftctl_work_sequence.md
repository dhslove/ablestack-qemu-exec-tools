- Follow-up improvements discovered during real-environment testing:
  - HA protect success detection should prioritize runtime `virsh dumpxml` mirror metadata when `virsh blockjob --info` is empty or incomplete.
  - `virsh domblklist --details` should be treated as a secondary indicator because it may continue to show the original source path while an active mirror element exists in runtime XML.
  - The current blockcopy target model is not valid for non-shared host-local storage.
  - Real HA/DR support now needs explicit backend-mode redesign:
    - `shared-visible blockcopy mode`
    - `remote-local transport mode` such as NBD-backed remote sink
  - Current local-file, non-shared cases must not be treated as PASS even when runtime XML shows a mirror element on the primary host.
  - `remote-nbd` protect can still appear as `syncing/copying` until `reconcile` runs; status auto-refresh policy should be improved.
  - Per-VM/target deterministic remote NBD port allocation and firewalld service range support are now in place; multi-disk concurrency validation is the next priority.
  - Multi-disk `remote-nbd` validation is now complete for transient qcow2 VMs; persistent single-disk validation is also complete.
  - Shared-visible HA validation is now complete for the single-disk persistent case.
  - Local-block validation is now complete for the single-disk transient case, including qcow2-on-block and raw-on-block.
  - Shared multipath now works on the tested stack when:
    - both source and target LVs are created on one host
    - activation ownership is split by role
    - secondary block-target activation performs stale dm cleanup and VG refresh before `lvchange -ay`
  - `remote-nbd` works for both raw-on-block and qcow2-on-block under that owner-separated model.
  - `shared-blockcopy` also works for raw-on-block and qcow2-on-block after switching block targets to XML `<disk type='block'>` descriptors instead of plain path arguments.
  - Mixed-kind HA validation is now complete for:
    - LVM raw block source -> GFS2 raw file target
    - LVM qcow2 block source -> GFS2 qcow2 file target
  - Windows qcow2 baseline is now complete after fixing UEFI/TPM VM generation.
  - Windows raw validation is now complete on the same UEFI/TPM generation path.
  - Mixed-size multi-disk validation is now complete for the transient local-file case.
  - Multi-disk raw validation is now complete for the transient local-file case.
  - DR transient VM behavior is now complete on the remote-nbd path.
  - DR baseline validation is now complete on the same remote-nbd backend model.
  - DR Windows raw validation is now complete on the same remote-nbd backend model.
  - DR persistent VM behavior is now complete on the same remote-nbd backend model.
  - DR Windows qcow2 now completes on the baseline path after secondary-space cleanup and remote-nbd observability/space-preflight hardening.
  - HA Ceph RBD baseline is now complete for:
    - `librbd` shared-visible mirroring
    - `krbd` shared-visible mirroring
  - DR Ceph RBD baseline is now complete for:
    - `librbd` shared-visible mirroring
    - `krbd` shared-visible mirroring
    - `krbd` host-separated `remote-nbd`
  - DR multi-disk Ceph RBD validation is now complete for:
    - `librbd` shared-visible mirroring
    - `krbd` shared-visible mirroring
    - `krbd` host-separated `remote-nbd`
  - FT/x-colo readiness is now complete on the `10.10.1.x` hosts:
    - sacrificial primary/secondary VM pair created with different backing qcow2 files
    - `parent0` / `colo-disk0` block graph created through qemu commandline
    - firewalld ports `9000/tcp`, `9998/tcp`, `10809/tcp` opened
  - FT baseline protect/failover is now complete for `FT-IMG01-ST01`:
    - protect reaches `colo_running`
    - failover reaches `failed_over` with `active_side=secondary`
    - a fresh file-based full failback validation now also completes:
      - `failback --force` returns the pair to `active_side=primary`
      - final state returns to `colo_running / mirroring`
    - file-based FT prebuilt pairs now perform explicit source/parent/hidden/active size validation before protect
  - FT persistent baseline is now complete for `FT-IMG09-ST01`
  - FT raw baseline is now complete for `FT-IMG02-ST02`
    - raw sources work when the secondary replication chain uses qcow2 overlays
  - FT local-block baseline is now complete for `FT-IMG01-ST03`
    - block-backed FT uses cold conversion, not the existing file-backed live protect path
    - primary and secondary generated XML use block-backed dummy disks with boot order lowered
    - post-boot QMP attach builds the local-block FT graph before x-colo handshake
    - a fresh block-backed full failback validation now also completes:
      - `failback --force` returns the pair to `active_side=primary`
      - final state returns to `colo_running / mirroring`
  - `OP-FT-01` is now complete:
    - first reconcile after induced transient loss enters `transient_loss` during the grace window
    - second reconcile after the grace window re-enters `xcolo_rearm()`
    - final FT state returns to `colo_running` / `mirroring` with `rearm_count=1`
  - `OP-FT-02` is now complete:
    - explicit `x-colo-lost-heartbeat` failover promotes the secondary side
    - final FT state reaches `failed_over` / `colo_failover`
  - FT `xcolo` planning now suppresses misleading standby materialization errors when `standby_xml_seed` is absent and the FT pair is pre-provisioned externally.
  - Host virtualization service model must remain untouched during testing:
    - do not switch hosts between `libvirtd` and modular libvirt daemons
    - do not enable/disable/mask libvirt host services from test automation
    - if `systemctl status libvirtd` or `virsh list --all` prechecks fail, stop the test and restore host health first
  - `OP-HA-01`, `OP-HA-02`, and `OP-HA-03` are now complete on the `10.10.31.x` `remote-nbd` HA baseline:
    - 1-second, 2-second, and 5-second export-port blips all recovered back to `protected / mirroring`
    - neither case incremented `rearm_count`
  - `OP-HA-04` is now complete with IPMI fencing on the `10.10.31.x` HA baseline:
    - the source host can be powered off through OOB/IPMI
    - secondary-side reconcile triggers fencing and standby activation
    - final state reaches `failed_over / failed_over` with the standby domain running on the secondary host
    - a fresh HA `remote-nbd` pair was then used to validate full failback:
      - after source-host recovery and cooldown, `failback --force` returned the pair to `active_side=primary`
      - final state returned to `protected / mirroring`
  - `OP-HA-05` should be executed only under the following design constraints:
    - preflight must verify both hosts respond to `virsh list --all` within a bounded timeout
    - the injected fault is limited to `virsh destroy <primary-vm>` on the protected source VM
    - test code must not touch host libvirt service-unit configuration or service model
    - success criteria are secondary standby activation and final HA failover state, not host service recovery
  - `OP-HA-05` is now complete on the `10.10.31.x` HA baseline:
    - source VM destroy triggers HA failover
    - final state reaches `failed_over` with the secondary side running
  - `OP-DR-01` is now complete on the `10.10.31.x` DR baseline:
    - a 2-second remote-path interruption recovered back to `protected / mirroring`
    - `rearm_count` remained `0`
  - `OP-DR-02` is now complete:
    - DR failover now tears down secondary `qemu-nbd` export handles before standby activation
    - standby verify no longer false-fails because the verify helper now propagates the observed domain state correctly
    - final state reaches `failed_over / failed_over`
  - `OP-DR-03` is now complete as full failback on the tested `remote-nbd` DR baseline:
    - after DR failover, `failback --force` completes reverse sync and cutback
    - final state returns to `active_side=primary`
    - final state returns to `protected / mirroring`
  - `OP-ST-01` is now reproducible on the dedicated `glue-gfs-2` filesystem path and is treated as PASS under the shared-storage-outage criterion:
    - pacemaker-managed GFS2 interruption is reproduced through cluster resource control
    - the engine first enters `standby_activate_failed`
    - after storage resource restore and another reconcile, it converges to secondary `failed_over / failed_over`
    - this is accepted because the shared target disappears from both hosts at once, so outage-window standby activation is not expected to succeed
    - the important PASS conditions are: no false-success failover during outage, no split-brain, and deterministic convergence after storage restore
  - `OP-ST-02` is now complete on dedicated `mpathk`:
    - one path can be forced `offline`
    - the engine remains `protected / mirroring`
  - `OP-ST-03` is now complete on dedicated `mpathl`:
    - all paths can be forced `offline`
    - the engine still remains `protected / mirroring`
  - `OP-LV-01` is now complete:
    - restarting `libvirtd` on the primary host during protection does not break the protected pair
    - after reconcile, the final state returns to `protected / mirroring`
  - Block-backed FT now has an explicit product policy split from file-backed FT:
    - file-backed FT keeps the current validated protect flow
    - block-backed FT must use cold conversion, not the existing live protect path
    - the current `FT-IMG01-ST03` direction is generated FT runtime XML plus block-backed restart conversion
  - On the `10.10.1.x` RBD hosts, `krbd + remote-nbd` required:
    - `firewalld` enabled on both hosts
    - `10809-10872/tcp` opened on both hosts
    - `krbd` secondary-target prepare to skip LVM-specific handoff steps and only perform idempotent `rbd map` plus target-format initialization
  - In the current multi-disk `krbd + remote-nbd` implementation, only explicitly mapped targets stay on `/dev/rbd/...`; unmapped secondary data disks fall back to file targets under `/var/lib/ablestack-vm-ftctl/remote-nbd-targets/...`, which is acceptable for current coverage but should be tightened if full per-disk krbd ownership is required.
  - That fallback is valid only for qemu standalone/non-Cloud-managed coverage. Cloud-managed remote Mold DR must use Cloud-created replica VM/volume resources and explicit disk maps as defined in `201-dr-remote-mold-cloud-managed-resource-ownership-design-20260514.md`.
  - NFS-backed DR filesystem cases are skipped in the current environment because GFS2 shared-visible filesystem validation is treated as equivalent coverage.
  - The remaining HA priorities are persistent local-block/raw variants and shared/multipath variants.
