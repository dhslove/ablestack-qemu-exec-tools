```text
<MODE>-<IMAGE>-<STORAGE>
```

Examples:

- `HA-IMG01-ST01`

## 10. Execution Rule

For each `Test ID`:

1. Collect environment facts from the operator
2. Generate exact commands
3. Execute on the real host by the operator
4. Collect evidence
5. Judge `PASS` / `FAIL` / `BLOCKED`
6. If failed, fix code and rerun the same `Test ID`
7. Do not modify the host virtualization service model during testing
   - do not switch between `libvirtd` and modular libvirt daemons
   - do not change systemd enable/disable/mask state for libvirt host services as part of a test
   - if host libvirt health precheck fails, stop the test and mark it `blocked` until the host is restored by an explicit operator action

## 11. Recording Rule

Every `Test ID` should end with:

- execution date
- VM name
- primary/secondary host
- image type
- storage backend
- commands run
- expected result
- actual result
- evidence path or log excerpt
- pass/fail/block reason

## 12. Current Follow-Up Notes

- `HA-IMG01-ST01`
  - Result: `FAIL` after reclassification
  - Observation:
    - In the tested ABLESTACK/libvirt/QEMU environment, `virsh dumpxml` mirror metadata was a more reliable confirmation signal than `virsh blockjob --info` or `virsh domblklist --details`.
    - However, the mirror target was still created on the primary host local filesystem, so the test did not produce a usable secondary-side HA replica.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Update HA protect observability logic to prioritize runtime XML `<mirror ...>` inspection when blockjob visibility is incomplete.
    - Redesign HA/DR backend modes so non-shared local storage uses a remote transport path instead of a primary-local mirror target.

- `HA-IMG08-ST01`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - The original primary-local path model failed for non-shared local storage.
    - After backend redesign, `remote-nbd` produced a secondary-local target, active NBD export, and primary runtime network mirror.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Keep `remote-nbd` as the required mode for non-shared local storage.
    - Consider auto-refresh after protect so `status` can move to `protected/mirroring` without requiring a separate reconcile step.

- `HA-IMG02-ST02`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - The same non-shared local storage model also worked for raw images.
    - The selected export port was persisted in state after reconcile.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Validate the same backend under multi-disk load where multiple target-specific exports are active at once.

- `HA-IMG05-ST01`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - Multi-disk local qcow2 worked with per-disk remote NBD exports.
    - Distinct export ports were selected and persisted for `vda`, `vdb`, and `vdc`.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Validate the same backend for persistent multi-disk VMs.
    - Validate failover/failback behavior across all protected disks together.

- `HA-IMG09-ST01`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - Persistent VM behavior worked with secondary-local target preparation and persistent standby define.
    - The standby domain name separation model (`<vm>-standby`) worked as intended.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Validate persistent multi-disk behavior.
    - Validate persistent failover/failback under the same backend.

- `HA-IMG01-ST04`
  - Result: `PASS` with `shared-blockcopy` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - Shared-visible source and target paths worked with a file-based blockcopy mirror.
    - The persistent standby domain naming and define path worked as intended on the secondary host.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Validate the same backend for multi-disk shared-visible layouts.
    - Validate shared-visible failover/failback behavior.

- `HA-IMG01-ST03`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - The local block backend required a secondary-local block target rather than a shared-visible path model.
    - An explicit `FTCTL_PROFILE_DISK_MAP` to the secondary LV path allowed `remote-nbd` to export a block device target and mirror the primary block-backed root disk over NBD.
    - The same model was also validated for a qcow2-on-block source LV.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Validate the same backend for persistent local-block VMs.
    - Validate multi-disk local-block behavior and failover/failback.

- `HA-IMG01-ST05`
  - Result: `PASS`
  - Observation:
    - The shared multipath environment itself is healthy and `vg_clvm01` has sufficient free capacity.
    - For a non-clustered shared VG, the valid ownership model is: create both LVs on one host, then split activation by role.
    - Under that ownership model, `remote-nbd` succeeded for both `raw-on-block` and `qcow2-on-block`.
    - `shared-blockcopy` also succeeded for both `raw-on-block` and `qcow2-on-block` once block targets were passed through XML as `<disk type='block'>` instead of plain paths.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Keep the owner-separated activation model explicit in product code for non-clustered shared VGs.
    - Validate operational failover/failback procedures for the same multipath layouts.

- `HA-IMG03-ST01`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - The Windows 11 baseline required explicit UEFI loader/NVRAM handling and TPM 2.0 in the generated libvirt XML.
    - Once the VM creation path was corrected, the same secondary-local remote-nbd model used for Linux local-file qcow2 worked for Windows 11 qcow2 as well.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Validate Windows raw images.
    - Validate persistent Windows behavior and failover/failback.

- `HA-IMG06-ST02`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - Multi-disk raw images followed the same secondary-local remote transport model as the qcow2 multi-disk case.
    - Per-disk export ports were selected independently and the final reconcile promoted the VM only after the slowest raw root disk completed.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Validate persistent multi-disk raw behavior.
    - Validate mixed-size raw multi-disk layouts and failover/failback.

- `HA-IMG04-ST02`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - The same Windows 11 UEFI/TPM generation path used for the qcow2 baseline also worked when the primary source disk and secondary target were raw files.
    - The controller promoted normally after the initial full copy completed.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Validate persistent Windows behavior.
    - Validate mixed-size Windows multi-disk layouts only if they become a target scope later.

- `HA-IMG07-ST01`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - Mixed-size and mixed-format multi-disk layouts also worked on the same secondary-local remote transport model.
    - Distinct export ports were allocated across the qcow2/qcow2/raw combination and all mirrors reached ready=yes in a single run.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Validate persistent mixed-size multi-disk behavior.
    - Validate failover/failback once this image mix is included in the HA operational suite.

- `DR-IMG01-ST01`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - The DR baseline on non-shared local qcow2 storage followed the same secondary-local transport model as the HA baseline.
    - `mode=dr` did not require additional backend changes once the remote-nbd path was in place for standalone qemu coverage.
    - This observation does not apply to Cloud-managed remote Mold DR, which must use Cloud-created remote replica VM/volume resources and explicit disk maps.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Validate DR transient and persistent image-behavior cases.
    - Validate DR site failover and reverse-sync/failback exercises.

- `DR-IMG08-ST01`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - DR transient VM behavior followed the same remote-nbd model as the DR baseline.
    - The standby side remained transient (`prepared-transient`) while still reaching protected/mirroring after reconcile.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Validate persistent DR behavior.
    - Validate DR failover/failback flows on the same backend.

- `DR-IMG09-ST01`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - Persistent DR behavior followed the same remote-nbd transport path as the DR baseline and transient case.
    - The standby domain naming and persistent define path worked as intended in DR mode as well.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Validate DR failover/failback and reverse-sync behavior.
    - Validate Windows DR behavior on the same backend.

- `DR-IMG03-ST01`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - Windows qcow2 DR initially exposed a mode-specific job disappearance after blockcopy start while the secondary export remained alive.
    - Secondary local target ENOSPC was identified and cleaned up.
    - An A/B replay of `baseline`, `AUTO_REARM=0 only`, and `defer standby prepare only` kept the job alive through the early trace window in all three cases.
    - A full rerun of the baseline case without experiment flags then completed and reached protected/mirroring.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Keep the remote-nbd free-space preflight and observability hardening.
    - Validate DR Windows persistent behavior after the DR transient path is fully normalized.

- `DR-IMG04-ST02`
  - Result: `PASS` with `remote-nbd` backend mode
  - Observation:
    - Windows raw DR followed the same remote-nbd model as the Windows qcow2 DR case.
    - The Windows 11 UEFI + TPM 2.0 generation path remained valid for raw source images in DR mode.
    - After the initial full copy completed, reconcile promoted the VM to protected/mirroring.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Validate DR Windows persistent behavior on both qcow2 and raw variants.
    - Keep checking secondary-local capacity because raw targets allocate aggressively during copy.

- `DR-IMG01-ST04`
  - Result: `SKIP`
  - Observation:
    - The current environment uses GFS2 rather than NFS for the shared-visible filesystem backend.
    - `HA-IMG01-ST04` already validated the shared-visible filesystem blockcopy semantics on GFS2, and that coverage is treated as equivalent for the NFS-oriented DR file-backed case in this environment.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Run the explicit NFS variant only if a distinct NFS-backed host pair becomes available.

- `DR-IMG05-ST04`
  - Result: `SKIP`
  - Observation:
    - Multi-disk shared-visible filesystem behavior was already exercised on the GFS2-backed shared filesystem path in the current environment.
    - That coverage is treated as equivalent for the NFS multi-disk DR case unless a separate NFS backend is introduced.
  - Follow-up improvement:
    - Run the explicit NFS multi-disk DR variant only when a distinct NFS-backed environment is available.
